Drone Service Client Satisfaction Analysis: January - November 2023

This project showcases a detailed analysis of client satisfaction data for drone service projects conducted between January and November 2023. Using Excel, I performed comprehensive data analysis to identify key trends, service performance metrics, and drivers of client satisfaction. PowerPoint was leveraged to create visually compelling presentations of the results, with a focus on clear communication and actionable insights.

Tools Used:
Excel: For data analysis, pattern recognition, and generating performance metrics, I utilized Excelâ€™s advanced functions (pivot tables, VLOOKUP, etc.) to gain insights into client feedback and project outcomes. Visual tools like charts and graphs were employed to highlight significant trends.

PowerPoint: All findings were communicated in an executive-level presentation, designed to clearly present complex data through clean visualizations and summaries. Key areas for improvement and recommended actions were visually mapped for stakeholders.

AI Integration: AI tools were incorporated to enhance data analysis, offering predictive insights into client behavior patterns and satisfaction drivers. This AI-driven approach helped prioritize improvement areas and forecast future satisfaction trends based on historical data.

This project demonstrates the power of combining traditional tools (Excel, PowerPoint) with AI to deliver data-driven insights, optimize service performance, and enhance customer satisfaction.
